# :books: The Project Description

Before we actually get into the code, I'd like to break down the code in sections. This will hep us to write the code in more organized way.


We have 4 smaller **boxes** inside the main component (  the ```.container```  ):

1. The Sign In form
2. The Sign Up form
3. The Sign In overlay
4. The Sign Up overlay
